Problem 1: (10 points)
Explain the statement <script type="text/javascript" src=”js/filename.js”></script>

	This is including an external file, in the local js directory, called filename.js, that contains JavaScript	code to be executed here.


Problem 2: (10 points)
What is the value of a[5] in the array declared below:

var a = [2, 4, 6, 'Joe', 10, [1, 2], {lastName: 'Smith'}];

	It is, itself, an array, containing the values 1 and 2.


Problem 3: (10 points)
 var myQuote="He who laughs, lasts.";

Give the value of each of the following expressions:
a. myQuote.toUpperCase()

	HE WHO LAUGHS, LASTS.

b. myQuote.indexOf("a")

	8
	
c. myQuote.indexOf("@", 1)

	-1

d. myQuote.indexOf("who")

	3

e. myQuote.indexOf("a", 10)

	16

f. myQuote.lastIndexOf("a")

	16

g. myQuote.lastIndexOf("a", 7)

	-1

h. myQuote.lastIndexOf("a", 10)

	8

i. myQuote.charAt(7)

	l

j. myQuote.charAt(myQuote.length)

	no value (looking for a character past the end)

k. myQuote.charAt(myQuote.length - 3)

	t

Problem 4: (30 points)
 Write a JavaScript function that accepts a string as a parameter and counts the number of vowels (aeiouAEIOU) within the string.

Note : As the letter 'y' can be regarded as both a vowel and a consonant, we do not count 'y' as vowel here.
Sample Data and output: 
Example string: 'The quick brown fox' 
Expected Output: 5

Hint: vowel_list.indexOf(str1[x]) !== -1

	function countVowels(inputString){
		var vowelSet = "aeiouAEIOU";
		var vowelCount = 0;
		for(var i = 0; i<inputString.length;i++){
			if(vowelSet.indexOf(inputString.charAt(i))>-1){
				vowelCount++;
			}
		}
		return vowelCount;
	}


Problem 5: (30 points)
 Explain Automatic Type Conversion in JavaScript.

	Since variables are loosely-typed in JS, their type may be coerced into other relevant types for
	the purposes of expressions, where the desired destination type is implied by the expression itself.
	For example, if an integer variable called A has the value 3, then in the expression (2 + A), A's
	value is interpreted as an integer to make this a mathematical expression, with a value of 5. In
	the expression ("2" + A), since 2 is a string (the literal character 2, not the integer value),
	A is turned into a string representing its integer value and then appended to the character 2, with
	a value of "23").

Problem 6: (30 points)
Provide the output to console

var x = "good morning!";

var f1 = function() {
x = "good afternoon";
};
f1();
console.log(x);
// What is outputted to console?

	good morning!
	
	(variables are function-local in scope, so the change to x inside the function doesn't affect the
	same-named counterpart outside the function)

var f2 = function() {
var x = "good evening";
};
f2();
console.log(x);
// What is outputted to console?

	good morning!
	(same as above)

Problem 7: (40 points)
 

Put the below data in a JSON formatted array where each individual is its own object. Then write code that will print each person's first letter of their first name and last name (example: msmith)

 

firstName: Mike lastName: Smith

firstName: Anna lastName: House

firstName: Mark lastName: McDonald

	var jsonArray = [
	{"firstName":"Mike", "lastName":"Smith"},
	{"firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"House"},
	{"firstName":"Mark", "lastName":"McDonald"},
	];

	for(var i =0;i<jsonArray.length;i++){
		console.log(jsonArray[i].firstName.charAt(0)+jsonArray[i].lastName);
	}


Problem 8: (40 points)
 Explain each line of this code:

var str = '{"foo": "bar"}';

	set a variable called str that contains the beginning of a JSON array.

console.log(str.foo);
	
	doesn't do anything, because str is just a string and doesn't have any meaning otherwise

var obj = JSON.parse(str);

	creates the variable obj and turns it into a JSON object, which now does contain the
	key/value pair of foo:bar

console.log(obj.foo);

	displays "bar"
